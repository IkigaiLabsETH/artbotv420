# Image Generation Fixes

## Summary of Changes

The following issues were fixed in the ArtBot image generation system:

1. **Image Dimension Limits**: Fixed the maximum dimensions for image generation to comply with API limits
   - Reduced FLUX model dimensions from 2048x2048 to 1440x1440
   - Ensured all other models use dimensions <= 1024x1024
   - Implemented proper dimension checks throughout the generation process

2. **Fallback Mechanism Improvements**:
   - Updated SDXL fallback model to use a specific version hash
   - Enhanced DALL-E fallback with proper error handling
   - Added fallback to DALL-E 2 when DALL-E 3 fails

3. **Logger Enhancements**:
   - Added missing methods to the AgentLogger class
   - Implemented logHeader, logSuccess, and logError methods
   - Ensured consistent styling across logging methods

## Technical Details

### Dimension Limits
- FLUX model: Max 1440x1440
- SDXL model: Max 1024x1024
- DALL-E 3: Uses 1024x1024, 1024x1792, or 1792x1024 based on aspect ratio
- DALL-E 2: Uses 512x512 or 1024x1024

### Model Versions
- FLUX Pro: black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro
- SDXL: stability-ai/sdxl:39ed52f2a78e934b3ba6e2a89f5b1c712de7dfea535525255b1aa35c5565e08b
- DALL-E Fallback: dall-e-3 with fallback to dall-e-2

### Error Handling
- Improved error reporting for Replicate API errors
- Added model-specific parameter adjustments
- Implemented cascading fallback strategy

## Testing
Successfully tested the changes with the test-varied-bear.js script, generating a 1024x1024 image with the FLUX model.

## Future Improvements
- Add configuration options for different model versions
- Implement aspect ratio preservation
- Add automatic retry with reduced dimensions
- Improve logging of fallback attempts
