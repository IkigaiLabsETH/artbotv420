```

### Plugin Architecture

The ArtBotV420 project is structured as an ElizaOS plugin, allowing for seamless integration with the ElizaOS ecosystem. This plugin implements a sophisticated multi-agent system for generating unique AI artwork in the style of René Magritte's surrealist bear portraits.

#### Key Components

1. **Multi-Agent System**:
   - Director Agent - Coordinates the creative process
   - Ideator Agent - Generates creative ideas
   - Stylist Agent - Develops artistic styles
   - Refiner Agent - Refines artwork
   - Critic Agent - Evaluates artwork

2. **Art Generation Pipeline**:
   - Concept generation
   - Style application
   - Image synthesis via Replicate API
   - Metadata creation
   - NFT preparation

3. **Plugin Integration Points**:
   - Custom actions for art generation
   - Service integration with ElizaOS
   - Web routes for image preview and management

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Setup environment variables (copy from example)
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - `REPLICATE_API_KEY` - Your API key for Replicate
   - Add custom API keys in the `.env` file

3. **Development Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Start development server with hot reloading
   npm run dev
   
   # Build the plugin
   npm run build
   
   # Run tests
   npm run test
   ```

```

### Extending the Plugin

#### Adding New Art Styles

To add a new artistic style to the generator:

1. Create a new style definition in `src/styles/`
2. Register the style in the style manager
3. Add style-specific prompt engineering in the appropriate agent

#### Creating a New Agent

To implement a specialized agent:

```typescript
// src/services/multiagent/MyCustomAgent.ts
import { Agent } from '../multiagent';

export class MyCustomAgent extends Agent {
  constructor() {
    super('my_custom_agent');
  }

  async process(input: any): Promise<any> {
    // Implement agent-specific logic
    return processedResult;
  }
}
```

#### Modifying Generation Parameters

To adjust the image generation parameters:

1. Update the model configuration in the Replicate service
2. Modify the default parameters in the art direction settings

### Publishing the Plugin

To publish this plugin to the ElizaOS registry:

```bash
# Ensure you're logged in with GitHub credentials
npm run publish
```

For npm publication:

```bash
# Login to npm first
npm login

# Then publish with npm flag
npx @elizaos/cli plugin publish --npm
```

### Contributing Guidelines

When contributing to the ArtBotV420 plugin:

1. Follow the ElizaOS plugin structure and naming conventions
2. Maintain the multi-agent system architecture
3. Document new features and agents thoroughly
4. Add tests for new functionality
