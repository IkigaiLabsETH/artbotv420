Render a distinguished bear portrait in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte, perfectly centered for use as a profile picture. The bear should have a stoic, impassive expression with a black bowler hat perched at a jaunty angle atop its head. 

Composition:
- Tightly cropped portrait of the bear's head and upper body against a flat, cloudy sky backdrop
- The bear's head should be slightly larger than life-size and centered in the frame
- The bowler hat should be clearly visible and recognizable, positioned at an improbable angle

Magritte's Painting Style:
- Smooth, matte finish with subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas
- Soft yet precise edges with careful control of values and gradients
- Deliberate, almost clinical paint application with minimal texture or impasto
- Muted, desaturated color palette reminiscent of Belgian skies
- Realistic yet simplified rendering of the bear's fur and features
- Careful attention to light, shadow, and tonal transitions

Render the bear portrait in oil painting technique, maintaining Magritte's distinctive style while ensuring suitability as a centered profile picture composition.
