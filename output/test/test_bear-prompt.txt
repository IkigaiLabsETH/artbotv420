"Create a perfectly centered portrait composition of a distinguished bear's face, rendered in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte's paintings. The bear should have a calm, pensive expression with intelligent, human-like eyes. It should be wearing a classic black bowler hat, slightly tilted, and a crisp white collared shirt.

Employ Magritte's precise, representational technique with a smooth, matte finish and subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas. Use soft yet defined edges with careful control over gradients and tonal transitions. Render with clean, unmodulated color fields reminiscent of Belgian skies, and pay close attention to realistic light and shadow.

The background should be a simple, neutral color field, perhaps a pale blue-gray, allowing the bear portrait to be the central focus. Maintain an overall sense of surreal juxtaposition while adhering to the formal qualities of Magritte's painting style."
