Render a formal portrait of a distinguished brown bear wearing a black bowler hat, in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte. The bear should have an impassive, slightly quizzical expression. Compose the image as a tight bust portrait, with the bear's face and hat filling most of the frame, centered for use as a profile picture.

Employ Magritte's signature elements:
- Smooth, matte finish with subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas
- Soft yet precise edges with careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies
- Deliberate, controlled paint application with minimal texture or impasto
- Clean, unmodulated color fields with subtle tonal transitions
- Precise yet painterly rendering of details like fur and hat textures
- Careful attention to realistic light and shadow on the bear's form

The overall style should evoke Magritte's Surrealist sensibilities, juxtaposing the natural bear with the man-made hat in an unsettling yet whimsical way that provokes deeper contemplation.
