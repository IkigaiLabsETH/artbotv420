Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a black bowler hat, rendered in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte. The composition should be centered and framed closely on the bear's face and upper body against a simple background.

Painting Style:
- Smooth, matte finish with subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas
- Soft, precise edges with careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies
- Oil painting technique with minimal texture or impasto
- Deliberate, controlled paint application with unmodulated color fields

Bear Portrait Elements:
- Dignified, anthropomorphized bear facial features with a stern yet pensive expression
- Formal, centered portrait composition with the bear's gaze meeting the viewer
- Black bowler hat as the sole human clothing accessory, positioned naturally
- Clean lines and shapes with precise yet painterly edges
- Careful attention to realistic light, shadow, and subtle tonal transitions
- Simple, uncluttered background in a muted, desaturated color

The overall piece should capture Magritte's surreal juxtaposition of the natural and human-made while maintaining his signature smooth, realistic painting style. The portrait format and close framing are optimized for a profile picture.
