"Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a bowler hat, in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte. The composition should be centered and framed for use as a profile picture.

Painting Style:
- Smooth, matte finish with subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas
- Soft, precise edges with careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies
- Oil painting technique with minimal texture and impasto
- Deliberate, controlled paint application with unmodulated color fields

Bear Portrait Elements:
- Regal, anthropomorphized bear with distinguished facial features
- Formal portrait composition with the bear's head and shoulders centered
- Bowler hat as the sole human attire, creating a surreal juxtaposition
- Clean, precise lines and shapes with subtle tonal transitions
- Careful attention to light and shadow, with a slightly dramatic lighting
- Neutral, simplified background to emphasize the bear's presence

Maintain Magritte's distinctive painting style, with a surreal and thought-provoking quality, while ensuring the portrait is perfectly centered and suitable for use as a profile picture."
