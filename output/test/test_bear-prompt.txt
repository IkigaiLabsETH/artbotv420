Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a black bowler hat and necktie, in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte. The bear should have an anthropomorphized, dignified expression and be rendered with Magritte's characteristic smooth, matte finish and subtle visible brushwork. Use soft edges with precise control, deliberate paint application with minimal texture, and careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies. Employ an oil painting technique with minimal impasto.

The composition should be a tightly cropped, centered bust portrait against a simple background of muted color fields with subtle tonal transitions. Pay careful attention to realistic light and shadow on the bear's features while maintaining Magritte's precise yet painterly edges. The bowler hat and necktie should have photorealistic detail to create a surreal contrast with the stylized bear form. The overall image must be perfectly centered and formatted appropriately for use as a profile picture.
