Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a black bowler hat, centered and framed for use as a profile picture. Render in Ren√© Magritte's distinctive surrealist style:

- Smooth, matte finish with subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas
- Soft yet precise edges with careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies
- Oil painting technique with minimal impasto and texture
- Precise yet painterly rendering of the bear's facial features and fur
- Clean, unmodulated color fields with subtle tonal transitions
- Careful attention to realistic light and shadow on the bear's form
- Simple, nondescript studio backdrop to remove contextual distractions
- The bear's expression should convey a sense of poise and quiet dignity
- Overall composition should be balanced and centered for profile picture use
