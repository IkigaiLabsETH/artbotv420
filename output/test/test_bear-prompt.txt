Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a black bowler hat, centered for use as a profile picture. Render in the style of Ren√© Magritte with his characteristic smooth, matte finish and subtle visible brushwork. Use flat color fields with soft, precise edges and careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies. Depict the bear's facial features with gravitas, seated upright against a plain background. Illuminate with directional lighting to create distinct light and shadow areas. Maintain Magritte's precise yet painterly technique with deliberate, unmodulated color application and minimal texture or impasto.
