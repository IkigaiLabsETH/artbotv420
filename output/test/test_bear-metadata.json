  "description": "A test of the ArtBot multi-agent system",
  "prompt": "Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a black bowler hat, rendered in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte. The composition should be centered and framed closely on the bear's face and upper body against a simple background.\n\nPainting Style:\n- Smooth, matte finish with subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas\n- Soft, precise edges with careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies\n- Oil painting technique with minimal texture or impasto\n- Deliberate, controlled paint application with unmodulated color fields\n\nBear Portrait Elements:\n- Dignified, anthropomorphized bear facial features with a stern yet pensive expression\n- Formal, centered portrait composition with the bear's gaze meeting the viewer\n- Black bowler hat as the sole human clothing accessory, positioned naturally\n- Clean lines and shapes with precise yet painterly edges\n- Careful attention to realistic light, shadow, and subtle tonal transitions\n- Simple, uncluttered background in a muted, desaturated color\n\nThe overall piece should capture Magritte's surreal juxtaposition of the natural and human-made while maintaining his signature smooth, realistic painting style. The portrait format and close framing are optimized for a profile picture.",

    "backstory": "Descended from a long line of ursine aristocrats, Sir Reginald Bearnard overcame the preconceptions of high society through sheer force of erudition and gravitas, earning the admiration of peers and monarchs alike with his groundbreaking theories on the interconnectedness of all existence -- a revelation he claimed came to him in a vision whilst donning his signature bowler for the first time. Ever since, the distinguished hat has served as both sartorial flourish and philosophical talisman, symbolizing his transcendence of the corporeal into the metaphysical realms of enlightened consciousness."
