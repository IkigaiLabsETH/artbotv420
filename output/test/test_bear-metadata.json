  "description": "A test of the ArtBot multi-agent system",
  "prompt": "Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a black bowler hat, centered and framed for use as a profile picture. Render in René Magritte's distinctive surrealist style:\n\n- Smooth, matte finish with subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas\n- Soft yet precise edges with careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies\n- Oil painting technique with minimal impasto and texture\n- Precise yet painterly rendering of the bear's facial features and fur\n- Clean, unmodulated color fields with subtle tonal transitions\n- Careful attention to realistic light and shadow on the bear's form\n- Simple, nondescript studio backdrop to remove contextual distractions\n- The bear's expression should convey a sense of poise and quiet dignity\n- Overall composition should be balanced and centered for profile picture use",

    "backstory": "Born into high society, Ursus Distingué cultivated an air of sophistication from an early age, donning his signature bowler hat as a symbol of his elevated status. His penchant for philosophical musings and insightful critiques propelled him to the forefront of the ursine intellectual elite. Yet, it was his groundbreaking work, \"The Surreality of Salmon,\" that cemented his reputation as a leading thinker, blurring the lines between the tangible and the enigmatic realms of existence."
