  "title": "Test Bear Portrait",
  "description": "A test of the ArtBot multi-agent system",
  "prompt": "Create a formal portrait of a distinguished bear wearing a black bowler hat, centered for use as a profile picture. Render in the style of Ren√© Magritte with his characteristic smooth, matte finish and subtle visible brushwork. Use flat color fields with soft, precise edges and careful gradients reminiscent of Belgian skies. Depict the bear's facial features with gravitas, seated upright against a plain background. Illuminate with directional lighting to create distinct light and shadow areas. Maintain Magritte's precise yet painterly technique with deliberate, unmodulated color application and minimal texture or impasto.",

    "backstory": "Born into a family of esteemed academics, Sir Cedric Bruinhart defied expectations by pursuing a life of distinguished civil service, eventually rising to the rank of Undersecretary for Ursine Affairs -- a position he retains to this day, despite the surrealist controversy sparked by his groundbreaking 1983 paper, \"This Is Not a Bear,\" which challenged the very notion of identity. His signature bowler hat, a nod to his philosophical musings on the absurdity of sartorial norms, has become a symbol of his unique perspective on the world."
