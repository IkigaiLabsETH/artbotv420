  "title": "Test Bear Portrait",
  "description": "A test of the ArtBot multi-agent system",
  "prompt": "\"Create a perfectly centered portrait composition of a distinguished bear's face, rendered in the distinctive style of Ren√© Magritte's paintings. The bear should have a calm, pensive expression with intelligent, human-like eyes. It should be wearing a classic black bowler hat, slightly tilted, and a crisp white collared shirt.\n\nEmploy Magritte's precise, representational technique with a smooth, matte finish and subtle visible brushwork in flat color areas. Use soft yet defined edges with careful control over gradients and tonal transitions. Render with clean, unmodulated color fields reminiscent of Belgian skies, and pay close attention to realistic light and shadow.\n\nThe background should be a simple, neutral color field, perhaps a pale blue-gray, allowing the bear portrait to be the central focus. Maintain an overall sense of surreal juxtaposition while adhering to the formal qualities of Magritte's painting style.\"",

    "backstory": "Born into the aristocratic ursine society, Sir Cedric Bearpington's impeccable sartorial distinction and unwavering commitment to propriety paved his path to becoming the preeminent ambassador of etiquette. His seminal treatise, \"The Unbearable Lightness of Bearing,\" revolutionized the very notion of dignified comportment, establishing the bowler hat as the apex of civilized headgear -- a philosophical statement as much as a fashion statement, questioning the thin line between the absurd and the esteemed."
