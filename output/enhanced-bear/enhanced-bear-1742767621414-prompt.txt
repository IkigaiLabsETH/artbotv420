A distinguished bear portrait in perfect profile wearing a bowler hat floating slightly above the head, silk cravat with impossible folds, with face partially merged with surroundings, dressed in a perfectly pressed suit with contradictory shadow, carrying vintage camera capturing what isn't there and accompanied by rose that casts shadow of another object, where interior space opens to exterior impossibly creates a reflection showing what isn't there, representing the impossibility of truly seeing what is there, rendered with perfectly rendered color fields with optical precision against precisely rendered landscape with surreal elements, with shadowless rendering with perfect edge definition, in mathematically precise arrangement of pictorial elements, painted in Ren√© Magritte's pristine surrealist style with immaculate surface quality, mathematically precise edges, and Belgian oil painting technique.
