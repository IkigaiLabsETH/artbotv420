A gnarled staff carved with the symbols of the old religion. A pouch containing runestones for divination and communion with unseen forces.\n\nAt the bear's feet lie scattered divinatory tools - tarot cards, rune stones, bones for casting the I Ching. But their patterns and meanings defy straightforward interpretation. The insights they offer are paradoxical, contradictory, forcing the viewer to transcend conventional logic. A naked truth lies behind their riddles, but one that can only be grasped through great sacrifice of preconceptions.\n\nThe background is hazy, indistinct, with only vague suggestions of form - perhaps the swirling mists of the otherworld, or the timeless forests, 35mm film, perfect lighting, photorealistic quality",
